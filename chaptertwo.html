"What the hell is going on??" Ace Harley looks around, still not believing that he just got transported to a different location at the same time all his friends did too. The room looked like something the government would have, a large monitor sitting on a far wall, a fake window with a satellite view of Earth on another wall. Seven tubes rise up, locks with the charms of the rings on pedestals in front of them. <br><br>
"Ace, what the hell did you find??" Zairen exclaimed, looking around and watching as the tubes rose up and stopped. The monitor turned on, the same diamond engraving that was on the jewelry box. A video file automatically opened, and began to play. An old man stood on the other side of the recording.

<i>"Hello, Diamond Legacy. If you are watching this, you are the new Diamond Legacy, which means a threat has risen. It is now the job of all seven of you to discover this threat, protect earth from it. The pedestals should now begin to glow along with your rings. Find your pedestal, and unlock your suits. Good Luck, Guardians. I have hope the rings have chosen well."</i>
<br><br>
The video ends and closes, and on que, the rings and pedestals glow. The Colors are synced; Zairen's ring is red so he goes to the red pedestal, Raven's ring is white so she goes to the white pedestal, Ace's ring is orange so he goes to the orange pedestal, Leo's ring is blue so he goes to the blue pedestal, Moss's ring is green so they go to the green pedestal, Evan's ring is black so he goes to the black pedestal, and lastly, Rin's ring is yellow so they go to the yellow pedestal. 
<br><br>
Zairen is the first to unlock to his suit. As he inserts his ring into the pedestal, the tube un-fogs, revealing a colorless suit. "Where are the colors?" he mutters. something inside the tube is sprayed, and once the smoke is gone the suit now has colors; Lime green and light gray, with red accents. "There they are." He added, answering his question.
<br><br>
The suit de-materializes, and the pedestal drones, two beeps following shortly after. An automated voice can be heard from the pedestal. <em>"Suit One, PSYCHE, has been loaded into the ring. Think about activating the suit, and it will appear."</em> Zairen, curious to test its truth, closes his eyes and thinks about activating the suit, Low and behold, it materializes on his body, along with a helmet. "Ooh, this is cool!" He chimed.
<br><br>
Raven is the second, she inserts her ring into the pedestal, the tube un-fogs, also revealing a colorless suit. colours spray and once the smoke clears, The suit is purple and white with gray accents. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The suit de-materializes, and the pedestal drones, two beeps following shortly after. An automated voice can be heard from the pedestal. <em>"Suit Two, REMNANT, has been loaded into the ring. Think about activating the suit, and it will appear."</em>  Raven does so, and the suit forms. 
<br><br>
Everyone else unlocks their suits;
Ace's suit Is Halo, Leo's suit is Star, Moss's suit is Ivy, Evan's suit is Cipher, and Rin's suit is Solar. Once they're all suited the monitor beeps, someone's contacting them. Zairen heads over to the monitor, he stares down at the controls. "I have no clue how to use this-." he remarked. raven walked up, and hit a button, answering the call. "Oh, it was the green one." he mumbled.
<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same old man from the recording stood in the video. "It was true. The rings chose, but.. You are all so young. How old are you, young man?" He asked, referring to Zairen. <br>
"I'm 16" He replied. The man looks astonished <br>
"My lord, what about everyone else here?" He inquired.<br>
"Well, Raven is 17, and everyone else here is 15, except me, as I mentioned."<br>
"The rings chose children. That's.. new." he's silent in thought.<br>
"So, who are you?"<br>
"Apologies. I was the leader of the old group, Psyche. Though, I've retired so you may call me Robert. you seem to be wearing my suit now, meaning you have the Mind Ring. I see the suits Star, Halo, Ivy, Cipher, Remnant and Solar, I remember working alongside the ones who wore those suits. I wish they were still alive to see the new Guardians." He said, reminiscing.<br>
"The Guardians?" Ace, now Halo, asked as he stepped closer.<br>
"Yes. You are the new Diamond Legacy, you have been chosen to protect the world. This must mean a threat has risen. You must find out what it is."<br>
"Woah, we just discovered we're superheroes, should we not train beforehand?" Zairen noted.<br>
"You are correct. You are a good leader already. The training room is through the door on the left."<br>

<br><br>
				
The training room was big, another monitor on a wall to the left. Roberts face appeared on it. "Lets start with Psyche. Your powers are tied to the brain, However lets start easy, Flight."<br>
"Flying is easy to you?"<br>
"Its beginner friendly, and the first ability I learned how to control. So we start with that."<br>
"Alright. I'll probably fall on my ass though." Robert chuckles.<br>
"To fly, you need to relax your muscles. Close your eyes and take a breath. Try to imagine yourself as a feather or in space. Clear your mind, and you should feel yourself beginning to levitate. Once you are no longer touching the ground, open your eyes." Zairen follows the instructions, he feels himself rise off the ground. Once he no longer feels the ground, he opens his eyes.<br>
"Oh god this is weird"<br>
"You're essentially using telekinesis on yourself, but using it on items or other people is not the same." Zairen struggles to balance himself upright. "As you can tell, you're not being affected by gravity. Because you are subconsciously creating a field around your body that negates the gravitational pull of earth."<br>
"How do I balance myself?"<br>
"Use the suit's wings."<br>
"Wings??"<br>
"Yes. Think about them and they'll appear" Zairen closes his eyes, and the wings appear like Robert said. He's quickly balanced up right. "After awhile of doing that, it will become subconscious."<br>
"Okay, that's better. How do I land?"

<br><br>

After learning the powers, the group, now exhausted, sits down. "That was a long training session" Halo said, taking off his cowl.<br>
"I apologize for pushing you. It was necessary, however."<br>
"Necessary how??" Rin, Solar, exclaimed.<br>
"You must know your powers to learn them." Before Robert could continue, an alarm echoes inside the building.<br>
"What's that?" Evan finally perked up, after hours of silence.<br>
"That's the Alert system, There's an attack." Robert looks panicked. Psyche walks over to the controls and, after a second of trying to find the button, he opens the map. A red dot appeared over the Canadian Museum of History.<br>
"Why is someone attacking a Museum?" Ace questioned as he walked closer to the monitor.<br>
"Its not a simple attack, its a bomb threat."<br>
"Okay, why would someone threaten to bomb a history museum?"<br>
"There's an event. Revealing a new and rare gem, The Alox Ruby. Named after the woman who discovered it, Lanya Alox."<br>
"How are we gonna get there. the monitor is showing that we're in a fucking mountain 26 hours of a drive away from the museum."<br>
"Well, Psyche can fly at 8,358 miles per hour, He'll arrive in 12 minutes. Remnant can fly 5,690 Miles per hour, she'll reach it in 18 minutes. Halo can fly at 1,278 Miles per hour, he will reach it in an hour and 24 minutes."<br>
"What about us? The ones who cant fly I mean?" Leo asked.<br>
"We have teleporters that are tied to the rings. When one of you arrives at the museum, you can stand in the teleporter and you will transport there in around 30 seconds."<br>
"Where the hell did you even get this tech?" Ace asked, surprised teleportation is actually possible.<br>
"6 Governments funded us as a thank you for keeping their countries safe."<br>
"Ah" Ace said, acknowledging the answer.

<br><br>

Psyche's voice comes over the comms. "Alright, Remnant, Halo, and I have arrived. You guys can get in the teleporter now."<br>
"Got it" Solar is the one to respond. They turn to the others, nodding. The four of them -- Solar, Ivy, Cipher, and Star -- step onto the teleporter and their surroundings glow a dark violet, and when it fades out they're at the museum.<br>
"Alrighty. Robert they're here. what now?"<br>
"You must be careful. Cipher, you should be able to see through the walls and see who's inside."<br>
"I can do that?"<br>
"Yes. Look at the museum and close your eyes, focus on seeing through your eyelids, which in turn will cause your vision to see the wall as invisible."<br>
"Uhh, okay I'll try." Evan closes his eyes, and his eyelids start become see through. "Its working!" He's now able to see through the wall.<br>
"Okay, what do you see?"<br>
"He has hostages, 5. He's holding a gun, but I don't see the bombs. There are 7 cops, and one negotiator." He opens his eyes.<br>
"Alright. Solar, can you try to wipe out the power?"<br>
"How would I do that?" Rin inquired.<br>
"Just focus your energy at the museum, it should knock the power out."<br>
"Alright" Rin stares at the museum, and after a moment the outside lights go out. Evan closes his eyes to check<br>
"It worked, the powers out." he said, opening his eyes again to look at Rin.<br>
"I did it!"
<br><br>
They make their way into the museum from an Employees-only entrance, the negotiator still doing her job. They hide behind a wall as they arrive behind the attacker, who's repeatedly reminds the negotiator that he will destroy the place if he doesn't get the ruby.<br>
"What is the plan?"<br>
"Halo," Roberts voice comes in from the comms again. "You are the second strongest member of the team. You have the Divine ring, making you mostly invulnerable. So you are the best candidate for this. Use a Halo-blade to pin him to a wall."<br>
"A what?"<br>
"A Halo-blade. Made of divine energy that you can manifest, similar to how you manifested the Angel Wings."<br>
"Okay, how do I manifest the blades?"<br>
"Just trace a circle in the air, the energy should appear, then grab the center for it to solidify."<br>
"Got it." Ace followed the instructions and looks at the blade. "I don't get it where is the sharp parts?"<br>
"You have to manifest those too, but you don't need them to be sharp for this. Just throw it at the enemy, and think of it locking around his neck and flying into a wall. It should pin him long enough for Star to get the hostages out and for Remnant to find the bombs. Just remember, keep focus, The halo-blades are heavily reliant on you keeping your focus for them to remain physical." Robert made sure the last sentence was enunciated.<br>
"Alright." He tossed the halo-blade, and did what Robert told him to do. The halo phased through the mans neck, but solidified before phasing completely through. It forcefully dragged him to a wall and pinned him against it, the man attempted to remove it only to be burned.
<br><br>
Star rushes to the hostages, quickly getting them to safety, and Remnant searches the museum for the bombs but finds none. "I cant find the bombs!" Remnant shouts to the team, startling Halo causing him to loose focus. The halo-blade vanishes and the man quickly fires a few rounds at Halo. Thankfully, Psyche uses his telekinesis to stop the bullets. However, the man quickly put his hand on a wall, and an explosion shook the building.<br>
"Damnit he's gone."<br>
"Did he take the Alox Ruby?" Robert swiftly asked.<br>
"No, its safe."<br>
"Good."<br>
<br><br>
The group arrived back at the base, exhausted now that the adrenaline wore off. "That went to shit quickly." Halo sighed, removing his cowl.<br>
"Yep, but at least the hostages and the gem are safe." Zairen said, reassuring that they still saved people. Roberts face appeared on the screen.<br>
"Yes. you all did good today, despite how you were unable to apprehend the man."<br>
"Bomber." Everyone looked at Ace.<br>
"What?" Zairen said, raising an eyebrow.<br>
"Bomber. His name. At least what we can call him, since we don't know his true name."<br>
"Good point. I am going to go home, have a shower and just relax, I am exhausted. And hungry." Evan said, his suit de-materializing back into the ring.<br>
"I think we could all use rest." Zairen said, chuckling.

"You failed, Danis."<br>
"There were seven of them! What the hell did you expect me to do??"<br>
"I expected you to do the job you were hired to fucking do, Danis."<br>
"You mean kidnapped?"<br>
"You failed. You wont be going home."<br>
"What? But you fucking promised-"<br>
"The deal only stayed if you finished the damn job! But, you didn't. Goodbye, danis."<br>
"No. Please, I have a fam-" A hole is shot through Danis's torso, blood pouring out from the open wound. He collapses.<br>
"I'll hire someone else to do the job."
