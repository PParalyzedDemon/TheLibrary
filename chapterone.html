			<p> The heat of the august sun beams against the back of Ace Harley's neck as he walks home from the mall, humming along to the music playing in his headphones. He walks past a familiar alley that's tucked between two large apartment buildings, however something seems different. There's a jewelry box inside, hidden behind a dumpster. Ace pauses and looks at it. "The hell." He takes off his headphones, pausing his music.
             He walks over to the box, the wooden lid fashions a confusing and eye-hurting design containing what looks to be diamonds layered in a weird way engraved on it. He kneels down, placing the bag beside him, and opens the box, and sees seven rings. "Why would someone toss cool rings?" He closes the box, puts it in his bag, and gets back up. He grabs his bag and continues home. <br><br>
				He shuts the door, sighing in exhaustion. "I'm back!" he announces. He walks over to the couch of which he sleeps on, and takes off his shoes. Turning on the fan, he sits down. A short moment later, he stands up and walks upstairs. He walks into his mothers room, placing the bag on her bed. <br><br>"I have returned, spawn-point." he says.<br>"Thanks bud" she says, thanking ace as he pulls out four 1 liter bottles of pop. "Card?" Ace promptly hands her the card. "Thank you" she thanks again, as she takes the card from his hands. <br>"I found something on the way back" Ace reaches back into the bag, pulling out the jewelry box. He places it down on the bed. <br>"What's that?"<br>
				"A jewelry box. With rings inside."<br>"Oh?" She looks at it curiously. Ace opens it to show the seven rings. One of them abruptly begins to glow a faint Red color. "Are they supposed to glow?" <br> "Nope" The glowing ring shoots up, levitating in front of aces face. "What the hell" it flies past him, and breaks through the screen of the back door and shortly vanishes from sight. <br> "That.. was not normal." <br> "You think?" <br><br>~| ZAIRENS POINT OF VIEW |~<br><br>


Zairen Oshoku was just chilling in his house, playing his guitar. He heard glass shattering from the living room, and got up to check. "Everything okay out here, mama?" He paused as he spotted a red light levitating in the middle of the living room. "What is that?" He hesitantly moves closer. <br>
"I don't know! It just broke through the window!" His mother said, confused. When Zairen was close enough to see what it was he was surprised. <br>
"It's.. a Ring?" the ring vibrates violently for a moment before beginning to circle around Zairen. "What the fuck??" it stopped right in front of him, the light dims down and the ring falls, Zairen catches it before it hit the ground. He looks at the ring. The charm is a brain. "That was weird but the ring looks cool."
<br><br>
He heads back into his room after the ordeal, and messages his friends telling them about what happened. After telling ace, he ended up in a Voice Call on discord with him. "So, you're saying you watched a ring glow red and.. just fly away?" <br>
"Yeah, Zai, that's exactly what I'm saying. I think that ring is now in your house." <br>
"How is that possible? You're like, hours, if not days, away from me."<br>
"It was pretty fast so" <br>
"Good point." Zairen Sighed. "Have any more rings fly away?" <br>
"No, not yet, thankfully. But, if that one did who knows which one will next?" As if on que, a white glow fades in out of frame. "Oh for fuck sakes." the white light is seen flying by the camera. Another ring. "Welp, lets wait and see who that ring goes to."

~| ACE'S POINT OF VIEW |~
<br><br>

Ace and Zai stayed on call for a bit, mainly just chilling and doing their own thing. Zairen's partner and ace's friend, Raven, shortly joined the VC. "I just had the weirdest experience." She says.<br>
"Let me guess, a glowing ring broke into your house and circled you for a minute before just stopping?" Zai says <br>
"Yes, that was- Wait how did you know that?" <br>
"Happened to me too. My mother almost got hit by it, it was like a bullet. The ring was cool though, it had a brain on it, so I kept it. I'm wearing it right now, actually." <br>
"Darling, why would you wear a cursed object?" <br>
"It looked cool! Anyways, Ace, has anymore rings flew off." <br> Before ace could respond, the bottom left of his face light up like a Christmas tree -- Orange, Blue, Green, Black, and Yellow glows came from out of frame. <br>
"Uh oh." Four out of the five colours that lit up flew off, however, orange did not move. It rose and then began circling ace.  "Oh, great now its my turn to see this-." the ring stopped and landed in his lap. The ring had a wing on it. He put it on. The box closed itself and the engraving glowed the same colors, but in an order; First red, second was white, third was orange, fourth was blue, fifth was green, sixth was black, and seventh was yellow.
<br><br>
Ace and raven watched as Zairen began to glow red then vanished. Raven began to glow white, and also vanished. Next, ace saw a flash of orange before appearing in a different area. "Ace??" Ace turned to see Leo, his boyfriend.<br>
"Leo?? What are- how are-?" He looked around and saw his friends; Zairen, Moss, Evan, Rin, Raven, and Leo. "What the hell is going on??"
